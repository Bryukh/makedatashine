The Global Financial Centres Index is published bi-annually by Z/Yen Group, the City of London’s most respected private think tank.

GFCI 23 provides profiles, rating and rankings for 110 financial centres, drawing on two separate sources of data - instrumental factors (external indices) and responses to an online survey.

103 factors have been used in GFCI 23, supplemented by 28,599 financial centre assessments completed by 2,340 financial services professionals.
