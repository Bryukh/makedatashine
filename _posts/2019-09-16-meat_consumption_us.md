Overall meat consumption has continued to rise in the U.S., European Union, and developed world. Despite a shift toward higher poultry consumption, red meat still represents the largest proportion of meat consumed in the U.S (58%). Twenty-two percent of the meat consumed in the U.S. is processed. According to NHANES 2003â€“2004, total meat intake averaged 128 g/day. The type and quantities of meat reported varied by education, race, age, and gender.
